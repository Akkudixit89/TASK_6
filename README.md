# TASK_6 CheckPasswordStrength
In this task, I took some example of password and checked the strength of those passwords that how much those passwords are strong.

Here, I show some examples of password and give analyzed feedback for that:
password123
✅ Length: 11 characters ❌ Complexity: Only lowercase and numbers ❌ Predictable: Based on common word “password” + numbers

Feedback:

Very weak. Easily cracked by dictionary or brute force attacks. Avoid using common words or simple patterns.

Password123
✅ Length: 11 characters ✅ Mixed Case: Uppercase P ❌ Still predictable: Common word + numbers

Feedback:

Slightly better, but still weak. Easy to guess using password attack dictionaries. Needs more complexity.

Password@123
✅ Length: 12 characters ✅ Includes a symbol: @ ✅ Mixed case + number + symbol

Feedback:

Moderate strength. Still has a common word ("Password"). Better than before, but try to avoid real words.

!2h%3hsg$ksh
✅ Length: 12 characters ✅ Completely random mix: Uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols ✅ Hard to guess/brute force

Feedback:

Strong password. Random and complex — hard for attackers to guess. Could be hard to remember, consider using a password manager.

Tacos&Books$Are#Great!
✅ Length: 24 characters ✅ Passphrase: Uses multiple unrelated words ✅ Includes symbols and uppercase

Feedback:

Very strong and memorable. Long length makes brute-force infeasible. A good example of a secure and user-friendly password.

# Best Practices for creating strong passwords:
Use 12+ characters. Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols. Avoid personal info. Don’t reuse passwords. Use passphrases (long and memorable phrases).

# Tips Learned from Password Evaluation
Length matters: Passwords with more than 12 characters are significantly stronger.
Avoid common words: Words like password, 123, or names are easily guessed.
Use mixed characters: Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
Don’t reuse passwords: Using the same password across websites is risky.
Passphrases are strong: Combining unrelated words with symbols is both secure and easy to remember.
Avoid patterns: Don’t use predictable sequences like qwerty, abc123, or repeated letters.
Use a password manager: These help generate and store strong, random passwords.
Update passwords regularly: Especially after a security breach or suspicious activity.
